So, an idea for code is to make a basic post framework as an initial skeleton

Bigger picture, I imagine a number of features:

 		- a basic blog posting set up (initially not commentable)
 X - done, needs a bit more test coverage

 - a sign in requirement to author / edit posts
 - a yearbook style profile / bio section
 - a chatroom feature running on top of the twitter api

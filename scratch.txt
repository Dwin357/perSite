12/30/15::0940 - outstanding issues

getting distracted, need to identify key issues and work them individually.
  - getting the image gallary working
  - getting the testing suit working

  images first
=======================================

So, an idea for code is to make a basic post framework as an initial skeleton

Bigger picture, I imagine a number of features:

 		- a basic blog posting set up (initially not commentable)
 X - done, needs a bit more test coverage

 - set up basic html skeleton & scss style

 - a sign in requirement to author / edit posts
 - a yearbook style profile / bio section
 - a chatroom feature running on top of the twitter api


 =======================================

 so what am I imagining right now?

 splash page is the background color with the gray border box and a picture in the middle

 after that it enters "areas"
 	- one area has a forest type background picture with interactive elements
